          <p class="card-text">
            Applying for a new job? A human resources representative or hiring manager may not be the first to review your resume. Instead, it might be an AI-powered tool.
            With some job postings attracting hundreds or thousands of applications, companies are increasingly using AI to sort through applicants before they reach a human recruiter. According to data from jobseeker resource site Resume Genius, 48% of hiring managers report using AI to screen resumes and applications, and the AI recruitment sector is expected to experience a compound annual growth rate of 6.1% between 2023 and 2030, according to the Society for Human Resources Management.

          <p class="card-text">US President Donald Trump has boasted “jobs and factories will come roaring back” as he unleashed unprecedented tariffs around the world during his “Liberation Day” address.
            With his sweeping global tariffs now in effect, steep price hikes on products ranging from clothing to electronics could largely be borne by American consumers. Now, a prominent tech analyst has warned that the price of an Apple iPhone could soar to around $3,500 if they were made in the US.

Tablets are not essential, but are nice to have around. With a wealth of apps for drawing, painting, and making music, they’re also a great outlet for creative impulses.

          <p class="card-text"> Meta has updated the privacy policy for its AI glasses, Ray-Ban Meta, giving the tech giant more power over what data it can store and use to train its AI models.
            The company emailed Ray-Ban Meta owners on Tuesday with a notice that AI features will now be enabled on the glasses by default, according to The Verge. This means Meta’s AI will analyze photos and videos taken with the glasses while certain AI features are switched on. Meta will also store customers’ voice recordings to improve its products, without an option to opt out.
