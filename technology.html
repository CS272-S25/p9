          <p class="card-text">
            Applying for a new job? A human resources representative or hiring manager may not be the first to review your resume. Instead, it might be an AI-powered tool.
            With some job postings attracting hundreds or thousands of applications, companies are increasingly using AI to sort through applicants before they reach a human recruiter. According to data from jobseeker resource site Resume Genius, 48% of hiring managers report using AI to screen resumes and applications, and the AI recruitment sector is expected to experience a compound annual growth rate of 6.1% between 2023 and 2030, according to the Society for Human Resources Management.

          <p class="card-text">US President Donald Trump has boasted “jobs and factories will come roaring back” as he unleashed unprecedented tariffs around the world during his “Liberation Day” address.
            With his sweeping global tariffs now in effect, steep price hikes on products ranging from clothing to electronics could largely be borne by American consumers. Now, a prominent tech analyst has warned that the price of an Apple iPhone could soar to around $3,500 if they were made in the US.

          <p class="card-text"> The best tablet can be a portable TV screen around the house and a way to get light work done away from your desk. Tablets are not essential, but are nice to have around. With a wealth of apps for drawing, painting, and making music, they’re also a great outlet for creative impulses.
