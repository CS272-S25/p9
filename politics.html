            The White House is calling out Amazon stating that their recent move is "hostile and politcal": Amazon recently stated that they
            are going to display how much Donald Trump's tariffs are adding to each product. Amazon has yet to confirmed whether they are going to 
            display how much the tariffs have added yet.

          <p class="card-text">US President Donald Trump has boasted “jobs and factories will come roaring back” as he unleashed unprecedented tariffs around the world during his “Liberation Day” address.
            With his sweeping global tariffs now in effect, steep price hikes on products ranging from clothing to electronics could largely be borne by American consumers. Now, a prominent tech analyst has warned that the price of an Apple iPhone could soar to around $3,500 if they were made in the US.

          <p class="card-text"> The best tablet can be a portable TV screen around the house and a way to get light work done away from your desk. Tablets are not essential, but are nice to have around. With a wealth of apps for drawing, painting, and making music, they’re also a great outlet for creative impulses.
